# ML System engineering with Go

This repo documents my personal collection of
methods, tools and conventions to design highly scalable, 
resilient, and cloud-native production systems for ml applications.

Main topics covered:
1. Basic Go language constructs and best practices
2. Code samples for the main low level topics in data engineering using the go standard
library wherever possible
3. Discussions of popular tool stacks for data engineering systems and ways to adopt them
into a manageable interface for a go based system
4.
