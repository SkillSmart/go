## Exercises to get you started
These exercises will help you get comfortable with
the basic functionality in go. 

The level of difficulty is increasing rather quickly, and i am trying to 
complement my solutions to the questions in the most idiomatic way possible as i am 
learning myself.

#### Use the exercises according to your level:
- Just getting started? -> Try to complete the exercises assuming an informed user.

- Experienced programmer starting with go? -> Try to build on your knowledge and provide exception
handling code that solves the requirements in the most reasonable manner. 

- Experienced in Go already? -> Try yourself with TDD practices and test and benchmark your code
to find potential loopholes and optimize your implementation wherever possible.

1. Create a program which prints “Hello World” to the terminal.
2. Modify the previous program so that instead of printing Hello World it prints Hello, my name is followed by your name.
3. Create a program that prints to the terminal asking for a user to enter their name. Use fmt.Scan to read a user’s name entered at the terminal. Print “Hello <NAME>” with <NAME> replaced with what the user entered at the terminal.
4. Create a program that prints to the terminal asking for a user to enter a small number and a larger number. Print the remainder of the larger number divided by the smaller number.
5. Print all of the even numbers between 0 and 100.
6. Write a program that prints the numbers from 1 to 100. But for multiples of three print "Fizz" instead of the number and for the multiples of five print "Buzz". For numbers which are multiples of both three and five print "FizzBuzz".
7. If we list all the natural numbers below 10 that are multiples of 3 or 5, we get 3, 5, 6 and 9. The sum of these multiples is 23. Find the sum of all the multiples of 3 or 5 below 1000.
