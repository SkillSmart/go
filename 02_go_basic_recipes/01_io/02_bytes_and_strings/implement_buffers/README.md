The bytes library provides a number of convenience functions when working with data. A buffer, for example, is far more flexible than an array of bytes when working with stream-processing libraries or methods. Once you've created a buffer, it can be used to satisfy an io.Reader interface so that you can take advantage of ioutil functions to manipulate the data. For streaming applications, you'd probably want to use a buffer and a scanner. The bufio package comes in handy for these cases. Sometimes, using an array or slice is more appropriate for smaller datasets or when you have a lot of memory on your machine.

Go provides a lot of flexibility in converting data between interfaces when using these basic typesâ€”it's relatively simple to convert between strings and bytes. When working with strings, the strings package provides a number of convenience functions to work with, search, and manipulate strings. In some cases, a good regular expression may be appropriate, but most of the time, the strings and strconv packages are sufficient. The strings package allows you to make a string look like a title, split it into an array, or trim whitespace. It also provides a Reader interface of its own that can be used instead of the bytes package reader type.
