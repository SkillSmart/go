# Applications in Data Engineering
This sections presents a collection of base application templates for a variety
of data engineering related challenges. 

As i am currently just getting started with application development in go, the
structure of the projects will go through constant adoption as i am learning more
about the practical challenges of growing and maintaining a project structure in go.

Aiming towards using this repo as a code base for production systems, i will be likely
updating them over time to include more battle tested, scalable architecture practices.
